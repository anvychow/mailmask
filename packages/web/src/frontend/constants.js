      'What is Mailmask?',
      `Mailmask is a service which lets you create an unlimited no. of temporary email addresses, all of which automatically foward emails to your real email address.

Mailmask additionally lets you to turn each of these temporary email adresss on or off whenever you like.`,
    ],
    [
      'Why would I want to use Mailmask?',
      `Temporary email addresses are a great way to:

1. Protect your real email address by keeping it private.
2. Stop spam from entering your inbox.

By allowing you to create unlimited temporary email addresses, Mailmask allows you to provide a unique email address for every person or online service you interact with.

Later on, if you wish to stop receiving email from a particular individual, company or online service you can simply disable the dispoable email address you created for them, leaving all the others intact.

In effect you now have fine-grained control over who gets to send you email, all without ever having to reveal your real email address!`
    ],
    [
      'How does Mailmask work?',
      `When you sign up for Mailmask you will set yourself a username. From then onwards, emails sent to **\`(anything)@(your username).${DOMAIN}\`** will be forwarded to your real email address.

For example, if your username is **\`jim\`** then emails sent to **\`test@jim.${DOMAIN}\`**, **\`fire@jim.${DOMAIN}\`**, etc will all be forwarded to your real email address.

Any time you need to give your email address to someone (e.g. when registering on a new website) you can instead give them an _alias_ address created on-the-fly, thus keeping your actual email address private.

For example, if your username is **\`jim\`** and you are registering on **\`nytimes.com\`** then you could use the alias **\`nytimes@jim.${DOMAIN}\`** to register. An email received at **\`nytimes@jim.${DOMAIN}\`** will be transparently forwarded to your email address with the sender knowing.

When you wish to stop receiving email from a particular sender you can go to your [Mailmask dashboard](/dashboard) and simply turn off that specific email alias, leaving the others enabled. Thus you can block spam or unwanted messages on a per-alias basis.`,
    ],
    [
      'How is Mailmask better than other temporary/disposable email services?',
      `Most other similar services require you to pre-create the alias address prior to use.

They often provide browser extensions to automate this process, though can never be as flexible as Mailmask which lets you create aliases without needing any additional sofware.

And indeed, this is Mailmask's _killer_ usability point - that **you can create aliases on-the-fly**.

Because Mailmask fowards all received email to your real email address you can keep using your existing mail client to read your email, unlike other services which require you to use their website.

When you need to turn an alias off (or back on) you can easily do so via [your Mailmask dashboard](/dashboard). Most other services do not offer this feature since their aliases are very short-lived in the first place.

Finally, Mailmask lets you reply to all received emails whilst still ensuring your privacy.
`,
    ],
    [
      'Can I use Mailmask for my personal and/or professional email?',
      `Yes, you can use it for any type of email.

Our system is engineered to handle any type of email (including large attachments) so there are no limitations to the kinds of email communication you can use it with.

We also don't store or scan any of your content on our servers so confidentiality is assured.

Note that Mailmask is also open-source, so you can also [self-host it](${SELF_HOSTING_GUIDE_URL}) for maximum security.`,
    ]
  ],

  ALIASES: [
    [
      'What is an alias?',
      `In Mailmask, an _alias_ is another name for a temporary email address which transparently forwards all received email to your real email address.

For example, if your username is **\`jim\`** then all email received at **\`test@jim.${DOMAIN}\`** will transparently be forwarded to your real email address.

Mailmask lets you create an _unlimited_ no. of aliases by simply changing the prefix (the bit before the **\`@**).

For example, if your username is **\`jim\`** then **\`an_alias@jim.${DOMAIN}\`**, **\`something_random@jim.${DOMAIN}\`**, etc wil all transparently foward received email to your real email address.`
    ],
    [
      'How do I create a new alias?',
      `Once you have registered with Mailmask and chosen your username, you can create a new email alias on-the-fly when you need to give someone your email address.

For example, if your username is **\`jim\`** and you are registering on **\`nytimes.com\`** then you could use the alias **\`nytimes@jim.${DOMAIN}\`** to register. An email received at **\`nytimes@jim.${DOMAIN}\`** will be transparently forwarded to your email address with the sender knowing.

If/when they send you an email Mailmask will automatically forward the messages to your real email address and the alias used will show up in [your dashboard](/dashboard).

To test this process out simply send an email to **\`test@(your username).${DOMAIN}\`** and then check that the **\`test\`** alias appears in the dashboard.`
    ],
    [
      'Where can I see all my created aliases?',
      `All aliases can be seen and managed in [your dashboard](/dashboard).`,
    ],
    [
      'How long are aliases valid for?',
      `All created aliases are valid forever.

To disable an alias, simply turn it off via [your dashboard](/dashboard) - any subsequent email received through that alias will be silently discarded.`
    ],
    [
      'How do delete an alias, i.e. stop receiving email through it?',
      `You can turn an alias off via [your dashboard](/dashboard).

Please note that once an alias is turned off we thereafter silently discard all email received through it without notifying you any further. So please be sure that you want to turn an alias off.`,
    ],
    [
      'How do I restore an alias, i.e. resume receiving email through it?',
      `You can turn an alias back on via [your dashboard](/dashboard).

Please note that once an alias is turned off we thereafter silently discard all email received through it. Thus, when you turn it back on you will not be able to catch up on the emails you missed in the intervening period.`
    ]
  ],

  PRIVACY: [
    [
      'Does my real email address truly remain private?',
      `Yes! It is not possible for a sender to work out your real email address from your Mailmask address.`,
    ],
    [
      'Will a sender know that I am using Mailmask?',
      `Unless a sender already knows that the **\`${DOMAIN}\`** domain represents the Mailmask service there is no other way for them to know that you are using Mailmask. From their point of view, the alias address you give them is the same as any other email address.`
    ],
    [
      'Is my email address still private when I reply to an email?',
      `Yes. When you reply to an email received via Mailmask it goes through Mailmask before it reaches the original sender.

This allows us to hide your real email address and thus ensure your privacy.`,
    ],
    [
      'Will senders know that I\'ve turned off an alias that they are currently sending to?',
      `When an alias is turned off Mailmask will silently drop all the emails received at that alias **without notifying the senders**. Thus the senders will not know that the alias is turned off.

This is by design and is intended as a security measure for your benefit.`
    ],
    [
      'Does Mailmask scan or store my email?',
      `We don't ever scan your email content for any purposes. In terms of storage, we only store your email in our system's outbound _sending queue_, from which it is gets removed as soon as it gets forwarded to you.`,
    ],
    [
      'How does Mailmask use my data?',
      `We do not store or mine any of your email data for information. And we do not add tracking information to your emails.

We do use analytics tracking cookies on our website to help us improve our website experience.

Please see our [privacy policy](/privacy) for more details.`,
    ],
    [
      'Is Mailmask open source? Can I see the source code?',
      `Yes, Mailmask is indeed open source. Our source code repository is located [on Github](${GITHUB_URL}).

We also have a [self-hosting guide](${SELF_HOSTING_GUIDE_URL}) if you wish to host Mailmask on your own server.`
    ],
    [
      'How can I keep it more private? Can I self-host Mailmask?',
      `Yes indeed! Please follow our [self-hosting guide](${SELF_HOSTING_GUIDE_URL}) for instructions.`

  LIMITS: [
    [
      'Are the aliases really unlimited?',
      `Yes! there is **no limit** to the number of aliases you can create. For real.`,
    ],
    [
      'Are there limits to the number of emails I can receive?',
      `There is no limit to the number of emails you can receive.

However, to ensure a fair service for all users we limit the amount of network bandwidth every user has access to.

Network bandwidth is a measure of the total amount of email data (text, attachments, etc) we handle for you within a given calendar month through your various aliases.

On the free _Basic_ plan, we grant ${SUB.BANDWIDTH.BASIC} MB of bandwidth per calendar month. This equates to receiving ${bandwidthStr(SUB.BANDWIDTH.BASIC)} per calendar month.

On the _Premium_ plan we offer hundreds of Megabytes of bandwidth per month, which equates to **several thousand** emails.`
    ],
  ],

  BANDWIDTH: [
    [
      'What is the monthly bandwidth limit?',
      `The monthly bandwidth limit is a measure of the maximum amount of email data (text, attachments, etc) we will handle for you within a given calendar month through your various aliases.

The bandwidth limit exists to ensure a fair service for all of our users. Your bandwidth usage data gets reset at the start of every calendar month.

On the free _Basic_ plan, we grant ${SUB.BANDWIDTH.BASIC} MB of bandwidth per calendar month.This equates to receiving ~170[average - sized emails](http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=312463) in a single month.

On the _Premium_ plan we grant hundreds of MB of bandwidth per month, which equates to **several thousand** emails.`
    ],
    [
      'Why do you charge for bandwidth?',
      `The more email data we handle for you, the more it costs us in bandwidth. Thus we feel it is only fair that we charge you on this basis as well.`,
    ],
    [
      'How is bandwidth usage calculated?',
      `The bandwidth usage for a given calendar month is calculated as sum total email data (html, text, attachments) handled for you via _all_ your Mailmask aliases from the beginning of the month until the end of that month inclusive.

This includes email forwarded to your as well as any emails (e.g. replies) you send back to senders via Mailmask.
`,
    ],
    [
      'Where can I see my bandwidth usage data?',
      `You can see the bandwidth used so far in the current calendar month by visiting the [your plan page](/dashboard/plan).

On the _Premium_ plan you will also be able to view the bandwidth used per alias.`,
    ],
    [
      'Do blocked emails / disabled aliases count towards my bandwidth usage?',
      `Only replies and emails which are forwarded to your real email address count towards your bandwidth usage.

If you turn an alias off in your dashboard, future emails received at that alias (which do not then get forwarded to you) do NOT count towards your bandwidth usage.

However, any replies you send to emails already received via a disabled alias will still count towards your monthly bandwidth usage.
`
    ],
    [
      'What happens if I exceed my monthly bandwidth limit?',
      `If you exceed your monthly bandwidth limit we will notify you by email, asking you to upgrade to a payment plan which has a higher monthly bandwidth limit.`

  PLANS: [

    [
      'Why does the Basic plan have a lower monthly bandwidth?',
      `It costs us to handle email for you, which is why we have to cap the monthly bandwidth for each plan.

On the _Basic_ plan, the monthly bandwidth of ${SUB.BANDWIDTH.BASIC} MB equates to ${bandwidthStr(SUB.BANDWIDTH.BASIC)}, which should
be enough for general use in most cases.

If your email data volume is greater than this then you are better off choosing the _Premium_ plan.`,
    ],
    [
      'What does the Premium plan offer?',
      `The _Premium_ plan offers everything the _Basic_ plan does, with the following improvements:

* **A higher _Monthly bandwidth_ limit of ${SUB.BANDWIDTH.PREMIUM} MB.**

This equates to ${bandwidthStr(SUB.BANDWIDTH.PREMIUM)}, as opposed to ${bandwidthStr(SUB.BANDWIDTH.BASIC, false)} on the _Basic_ plan.

* **Per-alias analytics.**

For each alias see stats for the current month such as how many emails were received and how much bandwidth was used. On
the _Basic_ plan we do not display per-alias statistics.

* **Manage multiple inboxes in one account _(Coming soon!)_.**

a new Mailmask account and new subscription for them you can add them to your existing account and manage everything in one.
